# Intern-tasks
This repository contains all the tasks that were completed during my Business Intelligence & Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. 

Tasks completed:

### Task # 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
Problem Statement: In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

### Task # 3 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
Problem Statement: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

### Task # 4 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm
Problem Statement: For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

### Task # 5 - To explore Business Analytics
Problem Statement: You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see how your company is performing. You are interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by looking into the data?

### Summary
The first chart tells which country is making profit and which is not. We can observe straight away that turkey,nigeria,pakistan,argentinia are not making profit and USA ,India is making profit.

Next chart shows which prdoucts are making profit. We can observe that technology category is making highest profit.
and in furniture tables sub-category is makng huge losses.
so analyzing that the sales of table is 757,042 and the actual cost is 821,125 which means it is making a loss.
The reason for the loss can be due to huge discounts.
When analyzing with year data we can see that table profit are declining by the years. The dsicount offered is highest
when it comes to table for almost 30%. So heavy discounting is eating up profits. Meaning sales are increasing for tables when heavy discounts are there.
 
Furthermore we observe that from the shipping details sheet that most of the profit is from standard class shipping and the shipping cost is also less.
The discount chart shows that USA has highest discount provided followed by the turkey.
