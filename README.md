# Intern-tasks
This repository contains all the tasks required to be completed during my Business Intelligence & Analytics internship at The Sparks Foundation. 

Tasks completed:

### Task # 2 - To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
Problem Statement: In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

### Task # 3 - To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
Problem Statement: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

### Task # 4 - To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm
Problem Statement: For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this
classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
